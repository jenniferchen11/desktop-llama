# Desktop Llama

### What is it?

Desktop Llama is a macOS app that adds a llama to your screen that accompanies you while you work. The llama's behaviour can be configured to either (1) follow your cursor around while you work, or (2) move at random. 
When clicked, the llama will be put to sleep and will stop moving, until it is clicked again.
Users can also swap out the llama for another gif.
