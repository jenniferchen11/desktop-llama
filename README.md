# Desktop Llama

### What is it?

Desktop Llama iis a macOS app that provides a companion whose behaviour can be configured to either (1) follow your cursor around while you work, or (2) move at random. 
When clicked, the llama will be put to sleep and will stop moving, until it is clicked again.
Users can also swap out the llama for another gif.

### Inspiration 

I was inspired by the desktop goose application: https://github.com/DesktopGooseUnofficial
